This project exceeds expectations.

I developed a fully-working distributed machine learning training solution for a custom convolutional neural network.
The only reason why I didn't give myself "Exceptional" is because I could not figure out how to convince SageMaker to
output my trained model. However, the metrics in the output show me that the CNN is learning, and a trained model is
being saved. This project is very well documented and it works. This distributed system uses many computers for storing
data, running the operation, and training the model. In my opinion, this is a fantastic final project and I had a lot of
fun working on it.
